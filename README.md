Despite having extensive sales data across multiple countries, product categories, and customer segments, the organisation lacks a unified analytical framework to derive actionable insights. Decision-makers are struggling to identify growth opportunities, optimise product portfolios, and understand geographic performance patterns due to the fragmented nature of data analysis approaches.

### Data Collection and Integration
---
My tutor, Mr. Josh gave me the dataset for analysis. The sales dataset was extracted, transformed and loaded into the Power Query editor for comprehensive analysis.

### Tools
---
- Power BI.
- Power Query.
- DAX.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
- Handled missing or null values in the dataset.
- Removed duplicate records.
- Added and removed fields where necessary.
- Corrected the datatypes.
- Created the date table to track sales across board.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
- Conducted summary statistics to understand the data better.
- Examined relationships among the various tables given. E.g. tables for Australia, Germany, Nigeria, USA, Japan, Geo, Products and Manufacturers.
- Joined the related tables above by appending them together for a seamless analysis.

### Visualisation and Insights
---
- Calculated measures to identify the various key performance indicators generated from the dataset.
- Developed visuals for my dashboard showing the revenue trend by year and month, total revenue by category, total revenue by country, top 5 manufacturers, e.t.c.
- Highlighted patterns using percentages and segment comparisons to uncover the highest sales revenue.

### Conclusion
---
This Power BI sales analytics project successfully transformed raw sales data into an actionable business intelligence platform, providing comprehensive visibility into global sales performance across multiple dimensions. The dashboard delivers critical insights that enable data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
#### Key Achievements:
- Developed 15 key metrics including total revenue, number of products, number of cities, average revenue, %urban, revenue trend by month and year, e.t.c.
- Developed trend analysis with line charts, sparklines and dates.
#### Strategic Insights Uncovered:
- Urban markets drive 79.30% of the total revenue.
- The convenience segment drives $1BN total revenue.
- Top products and manufacturers have been identified.
- Least products and manufacturers have been identified.
- Most sales across the years happen in the second quarter.

### Recommendation
---
1. Focus Resources on the Least Selling Products.
- Bundle low-selling products with the high-selling ones as bonuses. For example, “Buy product A and get product B free or at a discounted price.”
- Conduct customer surveys.
- Run targeted social media ads to interested but unaware audiences and low-performing cities.
2. Review and monitor the monthly performances of the bottom 5 manufacturers.
Ultimately,
* R - Reposition (Change perception).
