# Sales-Analysis-Project
This is my project for the completion of my Data Analysis course at Torilo Academy. 

# Problem Statement
A multinational retail corporation is facing challenges in gaining comprehensive visibility into its global sales performance. Despite having extensive sales data across multiple countries, product categories, and customer segments, the organisation lacks a unified analytical framework to derive actionable insights. Decision-makers are struggling to identify growth opportunities, optimise product portfolios, and understand geographic performance patterns due to the fragmented nature of data analysis approaches.
